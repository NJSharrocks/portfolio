      The Chester Romans American Football team are one of the oldest in the British American
      Football National Leagues, dating back to 1986. However, this season they decided to
      undergo a brand refresh, changing their team colours from red and black to red and white,
      whilst their junior team would incorporate a black and red kit. New promotional material
      was required along with a reworking of their sponsor's logo (with permission from the
      sponsor) to fit with the new kit.

      As a joint academy with youth, junior and senior teams, it was important to join the teams
      together on promo material advertising fixtures for their social media platforms but also
      tie in the differences. Therefore bold colours, matching each team's kit colours but also
      incorporating the overall academy colour scheme, were used. Sponsors' logos, team logos and
      bold fonts, as well as using the supplied slogan created a brand that can be stuck to going
      forwards.
