  <h1>Doggie Walks Website Build</h1>
  <h2>The Brief...</h2>
  <section>
    <p>A simple HTML5 and CSS3 website build with a single JavaScript function
    to create a simple but effective, responsive navigation. Aiming to meet a
    client's specifications, Doggie Walks blends supplied images, business colour
    scheme and personal creative license to result in a build that creates a
    point-of-call for new, prospective customers.</p>
  </section>

  <h2>The Build...</h2>
  <section>
    <p>Working to a Lean methodology, the Doggie Walks build was created with planning, design, implementation and testing phases,
      using sprint iterations to ensure the build was completed in a timely fashion, taking into account the required specifications
      given by the client.</p>
	</section>
			<section class="grid-4">
		      <p>Large points of call, with the contact phone number for the company displayed in large contrasting font on the header
					throughout the site build. Furthermore, this number is a link so that it can easily be called from the mobile site.</p>
		      <img class="portfolioImage2" src="images/doggieBuild/1.png">
		  </section>
			<section class="grid-4">
					<img class="portfolioImage2" src="images/doggieBuild/2.png">
					<p>The requested blue colour throughout the site matches the specification of the client whilst also contrasting well
					with the company logo supplied. Partnered with a white font, this works well together.</p>

			</section>
			<section class="grid-4">
					<p>Another site requirement was large images throughout the site, which can be seen on each page header and in the gallery.
					 The bold imagery of the photos supplied paired with the minimal white backgrounds throughout make the text and information
					 pop from the page. </p>
					<img class="portfolioImage2" src="images/doggieBuild/3.png">
			</section>
			<section class="grid-4">
					<img class="portfolioImage2" src="images/doggieBuild/4.png">
					<p>Another example of the colour scheme working throughout the site, with the orange paired with white, dark blue and light blue.
					Furthermore there is a prominence of the special offer as requested by the client.</p>
			</section>
			<section class="grid-4">
					<p>The footer spreads across the bottom of each page and displays the requested information from the client. The light blue colour
					continues the colour scheme whilst the dark blue font shows the opening times of the business and the contact details. </p>
					<img class="portfolioImage2" src="images/doggieBuild/5.png">
			</section>
			<section class="grid-4">
					<img class="portfolioImage2" src="images/doggieBuild/6.png">
					<p>The responsive mobile menu becomes a drop down behind a hamburger icon as opposed to the inline-block seen in the desktop
					version of the site. The dark blue background and white font pairs well, whilst the links become light blue on hover. </p>
			</section>
			<section class="grid-4">
					<p>The meet the team page displays each member of staff in a profile card, with image, name and title displayed. Whilst an
					effective way to display this information it is also incredibly easy to edit these in the case of staff changes. .</p>
					<img class="portfolioImage2" src="images/doggieBuild/7.png">
			</section>
			<section class="grid-4">
					<img class="portfolioImage2" src="images/doggieBuild/8.png">
					<p>The gallery is a requested feature of the client, showing the large images that they have supplied. Rather than a standard
					gallery grid to display the photos, the rows are not uniform, so that the images stay in their columns but can stretch to a desirable
					height. It is also responsive, creating more or fewer columns dependant on the width of the browser. </p>
			</section>
			<section class="grid-4">
					<p>The contact page displays maps for each of the business locations with links to get directions to these places. Displayed in profile
					cards with the same blue colour scheme, these match the rest of the site well. Furthermore a contact form has been styled underneath as
					requested by the client, which has also been styled in the same blue colour scheme. </p>
